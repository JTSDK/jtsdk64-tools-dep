== Proposal Cost Analysis

A <<cba,CBA>> determines when a particular investment meets or exceeds a cost
recovery point. For the purposes of our proposal, the following data was
used to compute the recovery:

* 10k/yr current application maintenance cost ($833.33/mo)
* Developer cost per hour fixed at $52.00
* 80 hours to port the main application to an <<mvc,MVC>> / <<webapi,Web API>> model
* 40 hours for database development
* 8 hours for data migration
* Cumulative monthly benefit ($206.67) for {gweshort} employees (conservative estimate)
* Second year sustaining costs estimated at 4hrs/mo ($208.00/mo)

Values translated into three tables, Employee Benefit, Development Costs, and Sustaining Costs
in <<cba-cost-benefit-breakdown>>

In <<cba-cost-matrix>> the savings from the current application maintenance costs 
are added as a montlhy benefit.

NOTE: After the first six months, the 4/hr per month cost should be considered
high in terms of estimates. If the system is properly designed, maintenance
would be self-sustaining

As indicated in <<cba-cost-graph>>, recovery occurs at the 9 month point 
when compared to the current maintenance contract.
