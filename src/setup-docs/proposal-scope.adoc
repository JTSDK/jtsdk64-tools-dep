== Proposal Scope

The scope of work for {gweshort} addressed in this analysis will include software,
hardware, data management and reporting that directly supports the proposed
change(s). Sections outlined in the needs assessment are to be considered
in-scope, while the residual is out-of-scope.

.[black]*Software*
As our primary product is a framework derivative, implementation dominates
the majority of scope. As such, the Model-View-Controller <<mvc,MVC>> is ideally
suited for {gweshort}'s <<needs-business-logic,Business Logic Needs>>

* Model represents the data aspects of an implementation
* View is what the client, or end-user, is presented with
* Controller is the go-between for data, and the web-page layout

<<mvc,MVC>> showing routes, requests, and client access.

Extending access to multiple client types is achieved through the <<webapi,Web API>>.
Adding such extensions improves productivity, ensures data integrity, and ease
of access. The <<webapi,Web API>> covers both the 
<<needs-application-interface,Application Interface>> requirements, and access to 
<<needs-data-warehouse,Data Warehouse Logic>> needs.

* Translates requests from supported devices
* Routes requests through the <<mvc,MVC>> Model
* Allows for easy extension to new device types

<<webapi,Web API>> showing device extension, and high-level data access.

.[black]*Hardware*
Hardware requirements for all proposed solutions are minimal. Existing
client machine needs remain unchanged. Any hardware capable of running the
existing desktop client will suffice for all three alternatives being proposed.

Any <<weberver,Web Sever>> capable of running <<dot.net,.NET>> applications
can provide the requirements for the <<webapi,Web API>>. Access to the 
<<intranet,Intranet>> <<weberver,Web Sever>> should continue through the <<vpn,VPN>>
services already in place.

.[black]*Data Management*
Using an <<rdbms,RDBMS>> will provide all the benefits indicated in the 
<<needs-data-warehouse>> section. In addition, adding a 
<<webapi,Web API>> class to the solution could provide access to <<ajera,Ajera\'s>>
customer records, thus allowing for:

* Correct account numbering
* Prevents the need to transpose account identifiers
* Provide access to Addressing and Point of Contact Information
* Long term, it could provide to time / cost allocation to <<ajera,Ajera>>
* Other key elements that are shared common between the system

Leveraging the <<webapi,Web API's>> authentication module can provide a 
*safe* yet extremely versatile interface between <<ajera,Ajera>> and the
Contract Module <<rdbms,RBDMS>> system.

.[black]*Reporting*
Reporting is one of the key items {gweshort} needed addressed. Utilizing an
<<mvc,MVC>> / <<webapi,Web API>> implementation, generating reports can be added
as needed with costs being a fraction of a full Desktop Application development
cycle.

* Standard reports can be built in
* Custom reports added when needed
* Dynamic SQL queries can be part of the interface
