== First Alternative
Our first alternative is to port the current application to <<java,Java>>.
It is one of the top programming languages and it's used in many 
modern applications all over the world. <<java,Java>> is object-oriented,
allowing for modular application development.

// turn numbering off for inner sections
:numbered!:

=== Objective
Our <<webapi,Web API>> proposal consists of rebuilding the front, and back-end
of the contract management system. Using <<java,Java>> will allow {gweshort} to
bypass the rebuild, to the back-end, required for the <<webapi,Web API>>. While
{gweshort} would still benefit from a rebuild of the back-end, which could
still be done with a <<java,Java>> implementation, it's not required to develop
a reporting module. 

=== Benefits
<<java,Java>> can be developed using open source <<ide,IDE>>'s allowing {gweshort}
to avoid licensing fees associated with enterprise level <<ide,IDE>>'s.
<<java,Java>> is a language taught in the region, this provides an additional
benefit of a more competitive market.

* Ability to end current maintenance contract.

* <<java,Java>> is cross-platform, meaning it can be installed on several
different operating systems.

* Flexability on development provides additional cost savings.

* Large number of developers creating a competitive market.

=== Cost Analysis
Considering the flexability of a <<java,Java>> implementation, our team has
provided a breakdown of the different routes {gweshort} could pursue to handle
the needs of the company, while keeping costs to a minimum. 

[black]*Port current application while adding a reporting module*

* 10k/yr current application maintenance cost ($833.33/mo)
* Developer cost per hour fixed at $52.00
* 80 hours to port the main application, add reporting module, and rewrite links
to the database.* Cumulative monthly benefit ($206.67) for {gweshort} employees
(conservative estimate) * Sustaining costs are higher than recommended proposal
due to the nature of a desktop implementation, requiring installs on every
device, estimating 8hrs/mo ($416) 

Values are represented in <<alt1-cba-breakdown-matrix>> accross three tables
Employee Benefit, Developer Costs, and Sustaining Costs.

<<alt1-cba-cost-matrix>> lists the current application maintenance costs and the
employee benefit added together as benefits. The maintenance cost benefit will
vary depending on when {gweshort} makes this payment, for the purpose of this
<<cba,CBA>> the maintenance costs are paid monthly. Costs are shown as an upfront
payment for development of the <<java,Java>> application, followed by monthly 
sustaining costs.

Our analysis shows recovery happening at approximately seven months,
as seen in <<alt1-cba-cost-graph>>.

[black]*Port current application, add reporting module, and database rebuild*

* Additional 40 hours required for database rebuild.

* 8 hours to create data migration application.

As seen in <<alt1-cba-updated-breakdown>> we have updated the Developer Costs
table to account for the addition hours required to handle the back-end.

While recovery is not seen until approximately the eleven month mark (<<alt1-cba-updated-cost-graph>>), 
{gweshort}'s new system will be more scalable. This intangable benefit will most
likely go unnoticed. However, this will simplify integration into other systems
as {gweshort} adapts to future needs.
