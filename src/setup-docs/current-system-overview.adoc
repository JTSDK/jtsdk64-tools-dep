== Current System Overview

The Information Technology (<<it,IT>>) manager is the contract system
administrator. Users of the system include, but are not limited to: President,
Business Unit Manager, Contract Officer, Accounting, Office Administration
and Engineering personnel.

Contract opportunities can originate from any number of sources: Sales, Marketing,
Direct Engineering, and sector-specific Request for Quotation (<<rfq,RFQ>>).

While initiation can be internal, or external, the iterative approval process
is grounded at the engineering level. Commercial interests are managed by
the sales force, and championed by the business unit managers. Final contract
acceptance resides with the company\'s president.

As with many small companies, key employees are responsible for fulfilling
several critical business roles; such is the case with <<gwe,GWE>>.
Administration of any given contract is managed, accounted for, and analyzed
by a small number of employees. Often times, executive-level managers take on
multiple roles in order to cover core business requirements. This multi-role
environment mandates a high-level of system automation, and integration into 
existing business applications.

<<contract-workflow-diagram>> shows the typical contract routing path for the
majority of {gwe} negotiations. While exceptions are possible, most adhere to
the routing indicated.
